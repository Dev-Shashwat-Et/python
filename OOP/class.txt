When Should You Use Classes?
USE Classes When:
You're dealing with multiple instances of similar things

You need to bundle data with actions

You want to create reusable components

You're modeling real-world entities

Your code is getting messy with many related variables

DON'T Need Classes When:
You're writing a simple script (< 100 lines)

You just need a one-time function

You're dealing with simple data transformation

The overhead isn't justified
