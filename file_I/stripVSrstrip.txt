No, in this case strip() and rstrip() do NOT work the same! There's a crucial difference.

The Key Difference
rstrip() - Only removes the trailing newline \n

strip() - Removes BOTH leading spaces (if any) AND the trailing newline

Demonstration
Let's say your names.txt contains:

text
Alice
  Bob  
Charlie
Using rstrip():
python
with open("names.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(f"hello, {line.rstrip()}")
Output:

text
hello, Alice
hello,   Bob  
hello, Charlie
Using strip():
python
with open("names.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(f"hello, {line.strip()}")
Output:

text
hello, Alice
hello, Bob      # Leading/trailing spaces removed!
hello, Charlie
When They Appear the Same
They only give the same result when your file has no leading/trailing spaces, like:

text
Alice
Bob
Charlie
Both strip() and rstrip() would output:

text
hello, Alice
hello, Bob
hello, Charlie
Which One to Use?
Use rstrip() if you want to keep any intentional leading/trailing spaces

Use strip() if you want to clean up all extra whitespace

For most file reading cases, rstrip() is safer because it preserves intentional formatting while only removing the newline character!

wo which one is better using in files
For reading files, rstrip() is generally better and safer in most cases. Here's why:

rstrip() is Preferred for File Reading
1. Preserves Intentional Formatting
python
# If names.txt contains:
# Alice
#   Bob  (indented for a reason)
# Charlie

with open("names.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(f"'{line.rstrip()}'")  # Keeps indentation: '   Bob  '
        print(f"'{line.strip()}'")   # Removes indentation: 'Bob'
2. More Predictable Behavior
rstrip() only removes what you expect (the newline), while strip() might remove meaningful spaces.

3. Common Use Case - Just Remove Newlines
When reading files, the main "unwanted" character is the newline \n at the end.

When to Use strip() Instead
Use strip() only when you specifically want to remove all extra whitespace:

python
# Cleaning user input or data processing
user_input = "   john doe   "
clean_name = user_input.strip()  # "john doe"

# When whitespace is definitely unwanted

✅ Also Good - Explicit newline removal:
python
with open("names.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(f"Hello, {line[:-1]}")  # Removes last character (if you're sure it's \n)
⚠️ Use with Caution - strip():
python
with open("names.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(f"Hello, {line.strip()}")  # Only if you want to clean ALL whitespace
Summary
Default choice: rstrip() - safer, preserves data integrity

Specific case: strip() - only when you intentionally want to remove all whitespace

In 90% of file reading scenarios, rstrip() is the better choice!
